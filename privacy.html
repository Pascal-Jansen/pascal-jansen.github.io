<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><em>Last updated: May 2025</em></p>

<h2>1. Controller</h2>
<p>
  Pascal Jansen<br>
  Magirus-Deutz Strasse 4<br>
  89077 Ulm – Germany<br>
  E-mail: <a href="mailto:pascal.j2@gmx.de">pascal.j2@gmx.de</a>
</p>

<h2>2. Server Logs</h2>
<p>
  When you visit this site, GitHub Pages (our hosting provider) automatically stores log files (IP address, date/time, requested file, referrer, user agent).  
  These data are processed for technical reasons (Art.&nbsp;6 (1) f GDPR) and deleted automatically after 30 days.
</p>

<h2>3. Cookies</h2>
<p>
  This site sets cookies only for web-analytics purposes (see Section&nbsp;4).  
  Cookies are small text files stored on your device; they are retained for up to&nbsp;24 months unless you delete them earlier.  
  You can block or delete cookies using your browser settings. If you do so, analytics measurements will no longer take place.
</p>

<h2>4. Google Analytics</h2>
<p>
  This site uses Google Analytics 4, a web-analytics service of Google Ireland Ltd., Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland (<em>“Google”</em>).  
  Google Analytics places cookies that allow us to analyse how visitors use the site.  
  The information generated (browser type, operating system, referrer URL, pages visited, session duration, truncated IP address) is transmitted to Google servers; IP anonymisation (<code>_ga<br></code>) is activated, so your IP address is shortened within the EU/EEA before transfer. 
  Data may be processed in the USA under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework or Standard Contractual Clauses.
</p>

<h2>5. Contact via E-mail</h2>
<p>
  If you contact me by e-mail, the data you send (name, e-mail address, message) will be processed solely to handle your request (Art.&nbsp;6 (1) b GDPR) and deleted when storage is no longer required.
</p>

<h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
<p>
  You have the rights to access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, data portability, and to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority (Art.&nbsp;15 – 21 GDPR).  
  To exercise these rights, e-mail the address above.
</p>

<h2>7. TLS Encryption</h2>
<p>
  This site is delivered via HTTPS; data in transit are encrypted.
</p>

<h2>8. Changes</h2>
<p>
  I may update this policy occasionally. The current version is always available at this URL.

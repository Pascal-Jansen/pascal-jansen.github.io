### About Me

I am a **PhD Candidate and Research Associate in Human-Computer Interaction** at the Institute of Media Informatics, Ulm University, Germany.

My research explores **interactive technologies that intelligently adapt to people's goals, abilities, and contexts**. I am particularly interested in how we can design systems that learn from users and respond in ways that make technology more **intuitive and inclusive** across diverse use situations.

By combining **human-centered design, empirical research**, and **computational methods**, I study and develop new ways for digital and physical environments to better support human needs, ranging from personalized interfaces to adaptive mobility and immersive experiences.

A significant part of my research involves the design of **simulation-based experimental frameworks**, including immersive virtual driving environments and optimization pipelines, that enable the systematic study of human-AI collaboration and personalization processes in mobility contexts. Through this research, I aim to advance the design of **transparent and trustworthy technologies** that integrate seamlessly into everyday life.
